# GameJam2018
Jalloo 2018 Game Jam

This was a 24 hour Game Jam held at the NBCC campus in Miramichi, New Brunswick as part of the Jalloo Festival of Games and Animation on June 16-17, 2018.

The theme for this Game Jam was 'how do you take a classic and ruin it'.

Our team consisted of 5 Visual Artists, 1 Sound Artist and 1 Programmer.

We chose to go with the Legend of Zelda and add paywalls to much of the content as inspired by EA's loot box debacle on Battlefront II.

This repository is the culmination of our combined work, which, while incomplete from our envisioned plan is still content/feature rich for only having been developed for 24 hours.
